*	Class to load classes to secure source code in insecure cheap public clouds
	This class will be used to safely deploy compiled serverless servces
*
*  Note this work is in abstract state, a Correponding Encryptor has to be coded when time permits to run before packing a jar. 
    Signing jars is an option, - by jarsigner and keytool for creating Dev or QA certificates by Keytool locally in any JDK is other option
