#Payment Gateway Setup

For enabling online payment transactions for your Enterprise / Web Application or Mobile App 
you will use a Payment Gateway for processing various credit cards, paytm or similar platforms, debit cards and various bank's internet banking services


Encryption

You will be given a Private Encryption Key from the payment gateway provider, that you will need to use this key inside any of your production Web Server's services codebase for encrypting transaction request, so as to enable that payment gateway servers to receive that request to decrypt your application's customer's transactions requests which you would encrypt by the Public Key part in your application codebase.


Many payment gateways provide keys for Stage and QA environments for evaluating their services for free.

Please refer various Payment Gateways' homepages for further information:-
