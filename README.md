# Payment Gateway Setup

To receive money for enabling online payment transactions for your Enterprise / Web Application or Mobile App 
you will use a Payment Gateway for processing money transactions for your company's products.


Encryption

You will be given a Encryption Key i.e. Access Code from the payment gateway provider, that you will need to use this key inside any of your production Web Server's services codebase for encrypting transaction request, so as to enable that payment gateway servers to secure  requests to decrypt your application's customer's transactions requests which you would encrypt by this Public Key part in your application codebase. This application's URL and/or IP address will be unblocked by Payment Gateway. The application code for processing money transactions of your app and/or your applications may be on different servers, i.e. Dev or Stage servers.


Many payment gateways provide keys for Dev and Stage environments for evaluating their services for free. They also access for customizing and branding web page as per your company needs, that will be displayed on your end user i.e customer's payment page containing options of Debit Cards, Credit Cards, Net Banking and even Paytm options.
